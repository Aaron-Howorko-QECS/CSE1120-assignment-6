## Tips
You are only changing the x coordinate of the circle in tis animation. For each new frame you can calculate the new x coordinate like this ```x = x + delta``` where ```delta``` is a positive number if the circle is moving to the right and a negative number if it is moving to the left. 

You will need to use an [if-statement](https://processing.org/reference/if.html) to determine the direction of movement. Your circle should start in the middle and start moving either left or right (initial direction does not matter). When it reaches one of the edges the direction of movement should reverse.

Review the [draw()](https://processing.org/reference/draw_.html) function to refresh your memory on how to animate in processing.
